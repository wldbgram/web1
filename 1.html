<h2>MANIAC</h2>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">You were with your friends, partyin'
<br>When the alcohol kicked in
<br>Said you wanted me dead so
<br>You show up at my home all alone
<br>With a shovel and a rose
<br>Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">People like you always want back
<br>What they can't have
<br>But I'm past that
<br>And you know that
<br>So you should turn back
<br>To your rat pack
<br>Tell 'em I'm trash</p>
