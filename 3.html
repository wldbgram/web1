<h2>Wish You Were Sober</h2>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober<br>
Sober, sober, sober</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">This party's shit, wish we could dip<br>
Go anywhere but here<br>
Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips<br>
And please don't drink more beer</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">I'm a crawl out the window now</br>
'Cause I don't like anyone around</br>
Kinda hope you're followin' me out</br>
But this is definitely not my crowd</p>
