<div id="article"><h2>Heather</h2>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater<br>
You said it looked better on me than it did you<br>
Only if you knew, how much I liked you<br>
But I watch your eyes as she</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Walks by<br>
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky<br>
She's got you mesmerized while I die</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Why would you ever kiss me?<br>
I'm not even half as pretty<br>
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br>
But you like her better<br>
(Wish I were Heather)</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand<br>
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder<br>
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel<br>
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she</p>
